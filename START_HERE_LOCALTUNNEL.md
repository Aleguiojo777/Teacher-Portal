## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Bookmark Your URL
```
https://teacher-portal.loca.lt
(Save to bookmarks for quick access!)
```

### Tip 2: Keep Terminals Visible
- Backend terminal: Shows server logs
- Tunnel terminal: Shows tunnel status
- Leave both visible while working

### Tip 3: Team Testing
```
Send them the URL
They can immediately:
✓ Login
✓ Create students  
✓ Record attendance
✓ View reports
✓ Test everything
```

### Tip 4: Multiple Subdomains
If "teacher-portal" is taken globally:
```bash
lt --port 3000 --subdomain=teacher-portal-v2
# or
lt --port 3000 --subdomain=teacher-portal-school-name
```
